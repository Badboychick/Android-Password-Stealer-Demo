# Password Stealer Demo

This app demonstrates how an app can use JavaScript to steal your password in a log in form. It specifically looks for Google's password box (specific minified class name). If you log into your account, it should show your password in a toast at the bottom of the screen. This could be stored without showing the user at all.
